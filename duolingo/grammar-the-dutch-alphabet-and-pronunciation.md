# Grammar: The Dutch Alphabet & Pronunciation


## 1. The Dutch alphabet

Our modern Dutch alphabet simply consists of the 26 letters of the ‘ISO basic Latin alphabet’. We have about five vowels and twenty-one consonants. Whereas the letter E/e is the most frequently used letter in our language, the letters Q and X are used least frequently.

Here you can find two introductory videos, [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTkvC8AU6XQ) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tSO5nuwfdE).

So, the Dutch alphabet has 26 letters - just like in English. In fact, you don’t have to learn any new letters! Hurrah!

## 2. Dutch pronunciation

However, as with any new language, there are going to be quite a few differences and peculiarities in pronunciation. Some letters are simply pronounced differently, and there can be combinations that may throw you for a loop. Don't worry, we're here to help!

## 3.Vowels and Diphthongs

The way Dutch vowels sound depends on whether they are in open or closed syllables.

A syllable is closed if it in a consonant sandwich (e.g. “bed”) and open if not (e.g. “ga”).

Instead of trying to explain the English equivalents of each vowel sound, it may be easier to check out this [website](http://www.heardutchhere.net/lesson1.html#vowels).

In Dutch, in addition to the vowels “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u”, and “y”, there are a number of diphthongs.

- "oe" sounds like the "oo" in "tooth"
- "eu" sounds like the "ay" in day with rounded lips, or like the "eu" in the French word "feu"
- "ei/ij": these sounds are like a combination of "eh" and "ee", similar to the "ay" in "day"
- "ui" is tricky, but can be described as a short "a" sound followed by a "u" sound. It is difficult to explain and understand in words, so listening and practicing to the audio in the link below can help.
- "uw" is a long Dutch "u" sond with a slight "w" sound
- "ou" and "au" sound similar to the "ou" in "loud"
- "aai" sounds like a long "a" sound followed by a long "i"
- "eeuw" long "e" sound followed by the "uw" diphthong from above
- "ooi" long "o" sound followed by a long "i"
- "oei" combination of "oe" and "ie" ("ie" is pronounced the same as a long "i")
- "ieuw" long "ie" followed by "uw"

## 4. Consonants

The consonants in Dutch – b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, z – are not too different from the consonants in English. You also have “ch”, “ck”, “ng”, “nj”, “sch”, “sj” and “tj”.

The major differences are the “g”, “j”, “r”, and “w”.

”g”

The “g” sound is not found in English. It sounds akin to coughing up a loogie, but I’d like to think it’s quite a bit more elegant.

The sound is made when air passes through an opening made in the back of the throat where the tongue and uvula (the dangly thing in the back of your mouth) meet. This is around the same area where your tongue and the roof of your mouth meet when making the English “g” sound.

If you are familiar with German pronunciation, the Dutch “g” sound is like the “ch” sound in the word “Dach”.

Check out this great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrI2-bZ7wpc) for an explanation.

In some foreign words, the “g” is pronounced as it is in the language the word was borrowed from.

”j”

The “j” sound in Dutch is straightforward – it is essentially the “y” sound as in the English word “you”. . ”r”

Then there’s the “r” in Dutch. There are several ways of pronouncing it. How should you pronounce it?

The first option is to roll your “r” using the tip of your tongue. Some people even just tap it instead of doing a sustained roll.

Another option is a more guttural “r”, once again using the uvula as with the “g” sound. It can be quite difficult to roll your r’s using this method, but with a lot of practice it can be learned.

Both of these “r” sounds come at the beginning or middle of words and sometimes at the end, but a lot of Dutch people pronounce the “r” kind of like an American “r” at the end of a word.

”w”

The Dutch “w” is not pronounced exactly like “w” in English, nor like a “v” sound.

The “w” in Dutch is actually called a “labiodental approximant” (ooh fancy!).

It is a bit like pronouncing the English “w” while having your teeth in lips in the same position as when pronouncing the English consonant “v”.

Consonant combos!

A quick explanation of “ch”, “ck”, “ng”, “nj”, “sch”, “sj” and “tj”.

- “ch” is pronounced like the Dutch “g”
- “ck” is pronounced as a “k” sound
- “ng” is like the “ng” in the English “sing”
- “nj” is kind of like the “n” in “onion” or for you language buffs out there like the Spanish “ñ”
- “sch” is often a combination of “s” and “ch” (as a “g” sound), but can also be pronounced as an “s” at the end of a word, for example “fantastisch”
- “sj” is pronounced like the English “sh” sound
- "tj” is pronounced like the English “ch” sound, but softer
